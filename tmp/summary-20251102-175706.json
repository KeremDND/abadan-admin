  "summary": "Fixed database schema mismatch - added missing columns (tags, colors, images) to Product table. The database schema was out of sync with Prisma schema. Added columns via ALTER TABLE and regenerated Prisma client. Error 'column category does not exist' was a Prisma client cache issue - resolved by regenerating client.",
  "current_status": "Database schema fixed - all required columns added (tags, colors, images). Prisma client regenerated. Products API should now work correctly."
