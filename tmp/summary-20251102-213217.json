  "summary": "Fixed the collaboration page header image path. The image file existed at '/Images/page images/Abadan Haly collab page.jpg' (with space in 'page images') in the root Images folder, but needed to be in the public folder to be accessible by the website. Copied the file to '/public/Images/page-images/Abadan Haly collab page.jpg' (using hyphen in 'page-images' to match existing folder structure) and updated the Collaboration component to use the correct path with .jpg extension.",
  "current_status": "The collaboration page header image is now correctly located in the public folder and the code path has been updated. The image should now load correctly on the collaboration page with the path '/Images/page-images/Abadan Haly collab page.jpg'."
