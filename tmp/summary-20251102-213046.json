  "summary": "Fixed the collaboration page header image path issue. The code was looking for '/Images/page-images/Abadan Haly collab page.jpg' but the actual file exists as 'Abadan Haly collab page.png' with a .png extension. Updated the src path to use the correct .png extension and added error handling with onError handler to fallback to the logo image if loading fails.",
  "current_status": "The collaboration page header image path has been corrected to use the existing .png file. Added error handling to gracefully handle any future image loading issues. The image should now display correctly on the collaboration page."
