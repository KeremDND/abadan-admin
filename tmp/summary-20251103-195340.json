  "summary": "Completed comprehensive audit of GitHub repository. Found: remote points to abadan-haly-complete (not Abadanhaly-admin), branches diverged (35 local commits ahead), but all core files, LFS config, security (no .env tracked), and structure are correct. Provided detailed audit report and sync commands.",
  "current_status": "Repository properly configured locally but needs sync with remote. Ready to fix remote URL and push all commits once user confirms correct repo name."
