  "summary": "Removed all lazy loading mechanisms from product images across the website. Changed all loading=\"lazy\" attributes to loading=\"eager\" in GalleryCard, Gallery, OptimizedCarpetPicture, and Hero components. Removed conditional lazy loading logic (index < 8 ? eager : lazy) and set all product images to load eagerly. Removed skeleton loaders from Gallery.tsx. Verified admin image previews already use FileReader for instant preview. All product images now load immediately on page load.",
  "current_status": "All lazy loading removed from product images. Images load instantly. Admin previews verified to work immediately. Ready for commit with message: fix(images): removed lazy load and ensured direct product image rendering"
